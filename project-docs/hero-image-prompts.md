# Hero Image DALL-E Prompts

All images should be **1200x400px** (3:1 aspect ratio), saved as **WebP** format, optimized to **<100KB**.

## Style Suffix (append to all prompts)

> Soft watercolor illustration style, muted earth tones (dusty rose, sage, cream, warm browns), gentle and organic, no text, no people, no hands, 3:1 aspect ratio banner

**Note:** Each prompt needs a concrete compositional anchor—a specific object, landscape feature, or botanical element. Abstract concepts alone drift into vague washes.
