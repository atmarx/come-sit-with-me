# Come Sit With Me

A perimenopause resource that integrates evidence-based medical information with traditional wisdom. The site aims to be what many women wish they had: a knowledgeable, compassionate guide through a transition that affects half the population yet remains poorly understood and rarely discussed.

## About

This project provides comprehensive information about perimenopause—the transitional years leading to menopause—covering symptoms, treatment options, lifestyle approaches, and the science behind what's happening in the body. Content bridges conventional medicine and complementary approaches, always grounded in evidence while respecting traditional knowledge.

The site is written in the voice of Brighid, a persona inspired by the Celtic goddess of healing, poetry, and the hearth. She speaks as a wise grandmother who has also read the research—warm and direct, never clinical or condescending. For more on the voice and content guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
