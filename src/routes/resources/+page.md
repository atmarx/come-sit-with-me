What follows is a curated collection of resources for going deeper—organizations to trust, research to know about, books worth reading.

I've tried to include only sources that are evidence-informed, patient-centered, and genuinely helpful. The internet is full of menopause content; not all of it is good.

## Organizations

**[The Menopause Society](https://menopause.org)** (formerly NAMS — North American Menopause Society)
The primary US professional organization for menopause. Their position statements reflect current evidence. Their provider directory includes NCMP-certified practitioners. This is where to go for vetted information and to find specialists.

**[International Menopause Society](https://imsociety.org)**
Global organization with an international perspective. Publishes guidelines and hosts major conferences.

**[Women's Health Concern](https://womens-health-concern.org)** (UK)
Patient-focused resource with accessible information. Good for non-US perspectives.

**[Australasian Menopause Society](https://menopause.org.au)**
Australia/New Zealand focus. High-quality patient and clinician resources.

**[NCCIH](https://nccih.nih.gov)** (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, NIH)
For evidence on complementary approaches—herbs, supplements, mind-body practices. They're honest about what's supported and what isn't.

## Landmark Studies & Guidelines

The research you should know about:

**Women's Health Initiative (WHI)** — The 2002 study that terrified everyone, and its subsequent reanalyses that changed the picture. Essential for understanding [the hormone therapy controversy](/support/hormone-therapy).

**SWAN** (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) — Long-running study tracking women through the menopause transition. Much of what we know about the experience comes from here.

**KEEPS** (Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study) — Helped establish the [timing hypothesis](/support/hormone-therapy).

**ELITE** (Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol) — More evidence for timing mattering.

**2022 NAMS Position Statement** on hormone therapy — Current consensus from the major professional society.

**2023 NAMS Nonhormone Therapy Position Statement** — Guidance on non-hormonal options.

**2025 Korean Society of Menopause Guidelines** — Part of the recent reassessment and modernization of guidance.

**SKYLIGHT and OASIS trials** — Clinical trials for the new NK3 receptor antagonists (fezolinetant, elinzanetant).

## Books Worth Reading

**The Menopause Manifesto** — Dr. Jen Gunter
Straightforward, evidence-based, with the right mix of science and sass. A good place to start.

**Estrogen Matters** — Avrum Bluming, MD & Carol Tavris, PhD
Deep dive into the hormone therapy controversy and the evidence for benefits. Particularly good for understanding the WHI fallout.

**The New Menopause** — Mary Claire Haver, MD
Recent, accessible, covers the range of symptoms and options.

**Come As You Are** — Emily Nagoski, PhD
Not specifically about menopause, but essential reading for understanding desire, arousal, and the spontaneous/responsive desire distinction. Life-changing for many women (and their [partners](/for-partners)).

## For Deeper Exploration

**Herbal resources:**
- *The Menopause Herbal* — Amanda McQuade Crawford
- *Herbal Healing for Women* — Rosemary Gladstar
- *The Web That Has No Weaver* — Ted Kaptchuk (for understanding TCM)
- *Adaptogens* — David Winston

**Finding practitioners:**
- American Herbalists Guild (herbalists)
- NCCAOM (acupuncturists/TCM)
- National Ayurvedic Medical Association (Ayurveda)

**Quality verification for supplements:**
- [ConsumerLab.com](https://consumerlab.com) (independent testing)
- USP Verified supplements
- NSF International certification

## A Note on Online Information

The internet is full of menopause content—some excellent, some terrible, some dangerous. Be cautious about:

- Miracle cure claims
- "The one thing doctors don't want you to know"
- Anonymous advice without credentials
- Sponsored content disguised as education
- Anyone trying to sell you something expensive

Prefer sources that cite evidence, acknowledge uncertainty, and don't have financial conflicts of interest. The organizations above are good starting points.
