What follows is a curated collection of resources for going deeper—organizations to trust, research to know about, books worth reading.

I've tried to include only sources that are evidence-informed, patient-centered, and genuinely helpful. The internet is full of menopause content; not all of it is good.

## Organizations

**[The Menopause Society](https://menopause.org)** (formerly NAMS — North American Menopause Society)
The primary US professional organization for menopause. Their position statements reflect current evidence. Their provider directory includes NCMP-certified practitioners. This is where to go for vetted information and to find specialists.

**[International Menopause Society](https://imsociety.org)**
Global organization with an international perspective. Publishes guidelines and hosts major conferences.

**[Women's Health Concern](https://womens-health-concern.org)** (UK)
Patient-focused resource with accessible information. Good for non-US perspectives.

**[Australasian Menopause Society](https://menopause.org.au)**
Australia/New Zealand focus. High-quality patient and clinician resources.

**[NCCIH](https://nccih.nih.gov)** (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, NIH)
For evidence on complementary approaches—herbs, supplements, mind-body practices. They're honest about what's supported and what isn't.

## Landmark Studies & Guidelines

The research you should know about:

**[Women's Health Initiative (WHI)](https://www.whi.org)** — The 2002 study that terrified everyone, and its subsequent reanalyses that changed the picture. Essential for understanding [the hormone therapy controversy](/support/hormone-therapy).

**[SWAN](https://www.swanstudy.org)** (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) — Long-running study tracking women through the menopause transition. Much of what we know about the experience comes from here.

**[KEEPS](https://www.keepstudy.org)** (Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study) — Helped establish the [timing hypothesis](/support/hormone-therapy).

**[ELITE](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00114517)** (Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol) — More evidence for timing mattering.

**[2022 NAMS Position Statement](https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2022/07000/the_2022_hormone_therapy_position_statement_of_the.4.aspx)** on hormone therapy — Current consensus from the major professional society.

**[2023 NAMS Nonhormone Therapy Position Statement](https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2023/06000/the_2023_nonhormone_therapy_position_statement_of.5.aspx)** — Guidance on non-hormonal options.

**2025 Korean Society of Menopause Guidelines** — Part of the recent reassessment and modernization of guidance.

**SKYLIGHT and OASIS trials** — Clinical trials for the new NK3 receptor antagonists ([fezolinetant](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Menopause&intr=fezolinetant), [elinzanetant](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Menopause&intr=elinzanetant)).

## Books Worth Reading

**[The Menopause Manifesto](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-menopause-manifesto-own-your-health-with-facts-and-feminism-jen-gunter/15542432)** — Dr. Jen Gunter
Straightforward, evidence-based, with the right mix of science and sass. A good place to start.

**[Estrogen Matters](https://bookshop.org/p/books/estrogen-matters-why-taking-hormones-in-menopause-can-improve-women-s-well-being-and-lengthen-their-lives-without-raising-the-risk-of-breast-cancer-a/8757336)** — Avrum Bluming, MD & Carol Tavris, PhD
Deep dive into the hormone therapy controversy and the evidence for benefits. Particularly good for understanding the WHI fallout.

**[The New Menopause](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-new-menopause-navigating-your-path-through-hormonal-change-with-purpose-power-and-facts-mary-claire-haver/20216189)** — Mary Claire Haver, MD
Recent, accessible, covers the range of symptoms and options.

**[Come As You Are](https://bookshop.org/p/books/come-as-you-are-revised-and-updated-the-surprising-new-science-that-will-transform-your-sex-life-emily-nagoski/18465554)** — Emily Nagoski, PhD
Not specifically about menopause, but essential reading for understanding desire, arousal, and the spontaneous/responsive desire distinction. Life-changing for many women (and their [partners](/for-partners)).

## Key Terms

**RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial):** The gold standard for testing medical interventions. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either the treatment being studied or a placebo/comparison treatment. "Double-blind" means neither participants nor researchers know who received what until the study ends—this prevents bias. "Systematic review" and "meta-analysis" combine results from multiple RCTs to get more reliable conclusions.

**Phytoestrogen:** Plant compounds that can weakly bind to estrogen receptors in the body. Found in soy, red clover, hops, and other plants. Much weaker than human estrogen but may provide some hormonal effects.

**Adaptogen:** Herbs traditionally believed to help the body "adapt" to stress by supporting the adrenal system. Examples include ashwagandha, rhodiola, and ginseng.

## A Note on Online Information

The internet is full of menopause content—some excellent, some terrible, some dangerous. Be cautious about:

- Miracle cure claims
- "The one thing doctors don't want you to know"
- Anonymous advice without credentials
- Sponsored content disguised as education
- Anyone trying to sell you something expensive

Prefer sources that cite evidence, acknowledge uncertainty, and don't have financial conflicts of interest. The organizations above are good starting points.
