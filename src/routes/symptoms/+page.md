What you're experiencing is real. All of it.

The heat that rises without warning. The nights you lie awake, mind racing or drenched in sweat. The fog that settles over your thoughts. The ache in joints that used to move easily. The desire that used to appear unbidden and now... doesn't.

These aren't signs that something is wrong with you. They're signs that your body is moving through a profound transition—one that affects virtually every system you have.

## What I'll Walk You Through

<CardGrid>
<Card href="/symptoms/hot-flashes" title="Hot Flashes & Night Sweats">
That sudden heat affects about 75% of us, with a median duration of 7 years. I'll explain what's actually happening in your brain.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/sleep-wont-come" title="When Sleep Won't Come">
About 40% of perimenopausal women struggle with sleep. Night sweats, declining progesterone, racing thoughts at 3 AM.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/mood" title="Mood Changes">
Depression risk rises 40% during this transition. I want you to understand why—and know that you're not failing.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/brain-fog" title="Brain Fog & Memory">
When words escape you and thoughts scatter. The research shows this is real, it has causes, and for most women, it improves.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/libido" title="Sexual Desire & Libido">
Changes in desire are among the most distressing and least discussed symptoms. This isn't about effort or trying harder.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/skin" title="Skin & Hair Changes">
The itching nobody warned you about. The dry skin, the thinning, the hair that's changed.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/aches" title="Aches & Joint Pain">
Feeling old in your body. This isn't just aging—estrogen affects your joints, and this is real.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/dryness" title="Dryness & Discomfort">
Unlike hot flashes, this doesn't resolve on its own. But it's also one of the most treatable symptoms.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/menstrual" title="Menstrual Changes">
From shorter cycles to longer gaps, heavier bleeding to skipped periods entirely.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/weight" title="Weight & Body Composition">
Why your body redistributes fat regardless of diet. The visceral fat shift, metabolism changes, and what actually helps.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/pelvic-floor" title="Pelvic Floor Changes">
Incontinence, prolapse, and why trampolines aren't fun anymore. More common than discussed, more treatable than you'd think.
</Card>

<Card href="/symptoms/sleep-apnea" title="Sleep Apnea">
Risk increases dramatically after menopause—and often goes undiagnosed in women. It's not just snoring.
</Card>

<Card href="/tracker" title="Symptom Tracker">
Track your symptoms over time. Find patterns. Bring data to your doctor. Everything stays private on your device.

## Something Important to Understand

Your symptoms correlate with estrogen *withdrawal*—not just low levels. This is why:

- The wild fluctuations of perimenopause can feel worse than stable postmenopause
- Some days you feel almost normal and others you don't recognize yourself
- Many women actually feel *better* once they're firmly through to the other side

The chaos has a pattern. The pattern has an end.

## Every Body Is Different

You may experience some of these, all of these, or symptoms not listed here at all. Your friend's experience may look nothing like yours. This isn't because one of you is doing something wrong—it's because individual variation in this transition is enormous.

The purpose of understanding what's happening isn't to fit yourself into a box. It's to have language for your experience. It's to know you're not alone. It's to have knowledge for conversations with [providers who may not understand](/finding-care). If it helps, you can [track your symptoms over time](/tracker)—patterns often emerge that aren't obvious day-to-day.

Right now, millions of women are navigating this same passage. Your mother did, and her mother, and every woman in your lineage stretching back through time.

They made it through. So will you.
