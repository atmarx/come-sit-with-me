You're exhausted. You're not [sleeping well](/symptoms/sleep-wont-come). You assume it's the [hot flashes](/symptoms/hot-flashes), the [racing thoughts](/symptoms/mood), the general chaos of perimenopause.

But there's another possibility that often goes unrecognized: sleep apnea.

Before menopause, women have significantly lower rates of sleep apnea than men. After menopause, the gap nearly closes. Something about this transition dramatically increases risk—and many women don't know to look for it.

## The Numbers

The statistics are striking:

<Cite id="sleep-apnea-menopause-prevalence" tooltip="Young T, et al. Menopausal Status and Sleep-Disordered Breathing in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 2003.">Sleep apnea is <strong>4.5 times more prevalent</strong> in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women.</Cite>
The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort found a 2.6-fold increased risk in postmenopausal versus premenopausal women. <a href="/considerations/surgical-menopause">Surgical menopause</a> carries even higher risk than natural menopause.

This isn't a small increase. This is a fundamental shift in risk profile that coincides with the menopausal transition.

## Why Menopause Increases Risk

**Hormones protect against airway collapse.** Estrogen and progesterone help maintain muscle tone in the upper airway. As these hormones decline, the airway becomes more prone to collapse during sleep.

**Fat redistribution matters.** The shift to visceral and central fat distribution that happens during menopause (see [Weight & Body Composition](/symptoms/weight)) affects neck and airway anatomy.

**Progesterone is a respiratory stimulant.** It literally drives your breathing. When it declines, respiratory drive decreases.

Recent research (2025) found that visceral fat accumulation specifically mediates the relationship between menopause and sleep apnea symptoms—meaning the way fat redistributes during menopause is itself a pathway to increased risk.

## What Sleep Apnea Looks Like in Women

Here's the problem: the "classic" presentation of sleep apnea—a heavy, snoring man who stops breathing in his sleep—doesn't capture how it often appears in women.

Women with sleep apnea may report:
- Insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep)
- Fatigue and daytime sleepiness
- Morning headaches
- Mood changes, depression, anxiety
- [Brain fog](/symptoms/brain-fog) and memory problems
- Waking frequently at night
- Restless sleep

Sound familiar? These overlap almost entirely with perimenopause symptoms. Which is why sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed in women—it looks like "just menopause."

Women are also less likely to snore loudly (or may snore more quietly), and bed partners may not notice breathing pauses.

## Why This Matters

Sleep apnea isn't just about being tired. It's associated with:

- **Cardiovascular disease**—increased risk of hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and atrial fibrillation
- **Metabolic problems**—insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, weight gain
- **Cognitive impairment**—memory problems, difficulty concentrating
- **Mood disorders**—depression, anxiety

Your cardiovascular risk is already changing during menopause as estrogen's protective effects wane. Untreated sleep apnea compounds that risk significantly.

A study from the American Heart Association found that women at high risk for sleep apnea had **three times higher risk** of poor cardiovascular health scores.

## When to Suspect Sleep Apnea

Consider getting evaluated if you have:

- Persistent fatigue that doesn't improve with better sleep hygiene
- [Sleep problems](/symptoms/sleep-wont-come) that seem out of proportion to hot flashes alone
- Snoring (ask your partner, or record yourself)
- Waking with headaches or dry mouth
- High blood pressure, especially if new or hard to control
- Any witnessed breathing pauses during sleep
- Daytime sleepiness severe enough to affect functioning

If you went through surgical menopause or early menopause, your risk is even higher.

## Getting Diagnosed

**Home sleep tests** are now widely available—you wear monitoring equipment while sleeping in your own bed. These are sufficient to diagnose moderate to severe sleep apnea in most cases.

**In-lab polysomnography** (sleep study) may be needed for complex cases or if the home test is inconclusive.

Ask your primary care provider for a referral to a sleep specialist, or request a home sleep test. If your provider dismisses your concerns, remember: this is an underrecognized condition in women.

## Treatment

**CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure)** remains the gold standard. Yes, it involves wearing a mask. Yes, it takes getting used to. Yes, it works.

Modern CPAP machines are quieter and more comfortable than older versions. Multiple mask styles exist. If you tried CPAP years ago and couldn't tolerate it, it may be worth trying again with newer equipment.

**Oral appliances** (mandibular advancement devices) can help mild to moderate sleep apnea by positioning the jaw forward to keep the airway open. These are fitted by dentists trained in sleep medicine.

**Weight loss** can significantly improve or even resolve sleep apnea for some people. [GLP-1 agonists](/symptoms/weight) have shown promise here, though research specifically on their effect on sleep apnea in menopausal women is still emerging.

**Positional therapy** may help if your apnea is worse when sleeping on your back.

**Hormone therapy** is interesting here. Research shows HT is associated with reduced sleep apnea prevalence—suggesting that replacing hormones may help restore some of the protective effects. This isn't a reason alone to start HT, but it's part of the picture.

**Surgery** is an option in some cases but is usually not first-line treatment.

## The Bigger Picture

Sleep apnea is part of the web of changes happening during perimenopause. It connects to:
- [Sleep disruption](/symptoms/sleep-wont-come)
- [Weight changes](/symptoms/weight)
- [Cardiovascular risk](/whats-happening/whole-body)
- [Brain fog](/symptoms/brain-fog)
- [Mood changes](/symptoms/mood)

Treating sleep apnea can improve many of these interconnected symptoms. Sometimes the exhaustion you attributed to perimenopause, the brain fog you thought was hormonal, the mood issues you've been struggling with—they improve dramatically when sleep apnea is treated.

If you're struggling with sleep and fatigue during perimenopause, please consider whether sleep apnea might be part of the picture. It's common, it's underdiagnosed in women, and it's very treatable.

You don't have to just push through exhaustion. There might be a fixable reason—one that has nothing to do with willpower and everything to do with your airway.
