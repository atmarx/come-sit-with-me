title: Terms & Conditions
description: Legal stuff, but the kind that protects both of us
---

We tried to make this guide feel like a conversation with a wise friend—but even wise friends need to be clear about what they can and can't offer. This page covers the legal realities of sharing health information on the internet.

## Not Medical Advice

**This is the most important section on this page.**

Everything on this site is for *informational and educational purposes only*. Nothing here constitutes medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. We are not healthcare providers, and reading this site does not create any kind of patient-provider relationship.

The information presented here is synthesized from peer-reviewed research, clinical guidelines, and reputable medical sources. We cite our sources. We try to present the evidence fairly. But:

- Research evolves. What we cite today may be updated or contradicted tomorrow.
- Your body is unique. What's typical for most people may not apply to you.
- Context matters. Your health history, medications, and circumstances affect what's appropriate for you.

**Please work with qualified healthcare providers** for any decisions about your health. If something in this guide resonates, bring it to your doctor. Print out a page. Ask questions. Use this as a starting point for conversation, not as a replacement for professional care.

If you're experiencing a medical emergency, stop reading and call emergency services.

## Trademark Notice

This site references various medications, treatments, and products by their brand names (such as pharmaceutical names that are trademarks of their respective manufacturers). These references are made for *identification and educational purposes only*.

- We have no affiliation with, sponsorship by, or endorsement from any pharmaceutical company or product manufacturer.
- Trademark names are the property of their respective owners.
- Mention of any product does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation.
- We receive no compensation of any kind for mentioning any product or brand.

We use brand names because that's often how people search for and discuss these treatments. When you see a drug name here, it's because the research we're citing used that name, not because we're promoting any particular product.

## Content & Copyright

The original content on this site—the synthesis, the voice, the structure—is our work. The research we cite belongs to its original authors and publishers, and we link to sources so you can read the original studies yourself.

You're welcome to share links to this site. If you want to reproduce substantial portions of the content, please [contact us](/about) first.

## Third-Party Links & Content

This site links to external resources: research papers, medical organizations, support communities, and other helpful sites. These links are provided as a convenience and for additional information.

- We don't control the content on linked sites.
- A link doesn't imply endorsement of everything on that site.
- External sites have their own terms, privacy policies, and content standards.
- Links may break over time as external sites change.

If you find a broken link or a linked resource that seems problematic, please [let us know](/about).

## Privacy & Data

We respect your privacy. Here's exactly what we collect:

**Analytics:** We use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/), a privacy-focused analytics tool. It tells us which pages are visited and roughly where visitors come from (country-level), but:
- No cookies
- No personal data collection
- No tracking across sites
- No selling data to anyone

**Local Storage:** If you use features like the symptom tracker or dark mode toggle, that data is stored in your browser's local storage—on your device, not on our servers. We never see it.

**No Accounts:** We don't have user accounts, logins, or email lists. We don't collect your email address unless you choose to contact us directly.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

This site is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied. We make no guarantees about:

- The accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information
- The availability or uninterrupted operation of the site
- The suitability of any information for your particular situation
- Whether following any suggestions will produce any particular outcome

We've done our best to provide accurate, helpful information. We've almost certainly made mistakes somewhere. Science is a process, not a destination, and our understanding of perimenopause continues to evolve.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we (the site creators) shall not be liable for any damages arising from your use of this site or reliance on its content. This includes but is not limited to:

- Any health decisions you make based on information here
- Any actions you take or don't take based on this content
- Any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the content
- Any interruption or cessation of the site

This isn't because we don't care—it's because we genuinely cannot predict how information will interact with your unique situation. That's why we keep saying: work with your healthcare providers.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms as needed. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date below.

## Questions?

If you have questions about these terms, please [contact us](/about).
