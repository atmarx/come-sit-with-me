title: Neurodivergence and Perimenopause
description: How autistic women and others with sensory processing differences may experience perimenopause differently
---

If you're autistic, have ADHD, or experience the world through different sensory and cognitive wiring, perimenopause may hit differently than the mainstream descriptions suggest.

The research is only beginning to catch up to what neurodivergent women have been saying for years: this transition can be particularly challenging when your nervous system already processes sensation and emotion intensely.

## What the Research Is Starting to Show

A 2024 Swansea University study—one of the first to specifically examine this intersection—found that autistic individuals often experience:

- **More severe menopause symptoms overall**
- **Intensified sensory experiences** of physical symptoms
- **Barriers to getting support and recognition**
- **Healthcare interactions that don't work** the way they're supposed to

This isn't because autistic women are imagining things or being dramatic. It's because sensory processing differences are real, and symptoms that involve the body and its sensations—[hot flashes](/symptoms/hot-flashes), [skin changes](/symptoms/skin), [aches](/symptoms/aches), temperature dysregulation—land differently when your nervous system is wired differently.

## Sensory Aspects

For neurotypical women, a hot flash is uncomfortable. For someone with sensory sensitivities, it can be overwhelming, even intolerable.

Consider:
- The feeling of sweat on your skin
- The sensation of temperature change
- The flushing, the racing heart
- Clothing suddenly feeling unbearable

If your baseline is already managing sensory input carefully, adding perimenopause symptoms to the mix can push you past capacity.

Similarly:
- [Itching and skin changes](/symptoms/skin) may be more distressing
- [Sleep disruption](/symptoms/sleep-wont-come) may be harder to recover from
- [Brain fog](/symptoms/brain-fog) may compound existing executive function challenges
- [Mood changes](/symptoms/mood) may be harder to regulate when your baseline regulation takes effort

## The Healthcare Problem

Many neurodivergent women struggle to get appropriate care—for perimenopause and in general. This happens for several reasons:

**You may not describe symptoms in expected ways.** Medical training teaches providers to listen for specific phrases and presentations. If you describe your experience differently—more precisely, more metaphorically, more analytically—providers may not recognize what you're saying.

**Masking hides the severity.** If you've spent your life learning to appear "normal" and minimizing visible distress, providers may not realize how much you're struggling. The effort to mask during appointments costs energy you can't afford to spend.

**Healthcare settings are overwhelming.** Waiting rooms, fluorescent lights, paper gowns, unpredictable wait times—medical environments are often sensory nightmares that make it harder to communicate effectively.

**You may not receive validation.** Providers who don't understand neurodivergence may attribute your symptoms to anxiety, dismiss you as "too sensitive," or miss the connection between your neurology and your perimenopause experience.

## What Might Help

**Written symptom tracking.** Rather than trying to communicate verbally in overwhelming appointments, track symptoms in writing beforehand. Bring notes. Email them ahead if possible.

**Request accommodations.** Ask to wait somewhere quieter. Request the first or last appointment of the day. Explain what you need for the appointment to work.

**Seek understanding providers.** Some providers understand neurodivergence; many don't. It's worth seeking out providers who get it—even if it takes more effort to find them.

**Online communities.** Neurodivergent women going through perimenopause have found each other online. These communities offer validation, shared experience, and practical tips from people who actually understand.

**Consider [your specific sensitivities](/support/lifestyle) in treatment choices.** If transdermal patches cause sensory distress, other delivery methods exist. If certain medications have intolerable side effects for your nervous system, alternatives may be available. Advocate for options that work with your neurology, not against it.

## What Providers Should Know

If you're bringing this page to show a provider:

- Neurodivergent individuals often experience physical sensations more intensely
- Symptom descriptions may not match textbook presentations
- Masking can hide symptom severity
- The patient is the expert on their own experience
- Accommodations for sensory and communication differences improve care

## Research Is Growing

This is an emerging area of study. The intersection of neurodivergence and menopause has been largely ignored by research until recently. What we have now are preliminary findings and a growing collection of lived experience reports.

More research is needed. In the meantime, your experience is valid even if it doesn't yet have extensive clinical literature behind it.

If you're neurodivergent and struggling through perimenopause, I want you to know: it's not in your head. You're not being too sensitive. Your nervous system processes this transition differently, and that deserves recognition—from your providers, from the people around you, and from yourself.

You deserve support that actually works for how you're wired, not support designed for a neurotype you don't have.
