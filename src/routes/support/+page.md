Perimenopause isn't a disease to be cured. It's a biological transition to be understood and, if you choose, supported.

The options in this section aren't about "fixing" you—there's nothing broken. They're tools. Some women use many of them; some use none. What matters is that you have choices, and you understand those choices well enough to make the ones that fit your life, your body, your values.

## What I Want You to Understand

"Every body is different" is true, and it's also frustrating when you want someone to just tell you what to do. So let me be clear about what this section can and can't offer:

**What I can do:**
- Help you understand *why* things are happening in your body
- Show you what options exist and what the evidence actually says (including when evidence is limited)
- Give you language for conversations with providers
- Offer a framework for your own experimentation

**What I can't do:**
- Tell you what will work for *you*—only your body knows that
- Promise that anything will eliminate your symptoms entirely
- Replace a provider who knows your medical history

Your path through this transition is yours alone. But you don't have to walk it uninformed.

## On Evidence and Honesty

I hold no allegiance to "natural" versus "medical." I've seen sage tea help one woman and fail another. I've seen estrogen transform lives and cause suffering in equal measure. What works is what works for you.

What I promise is honesty:
- When evidence is strong, I'll say so
- When evidence is limited or mixed, I'll say that too
- When something is traditional but unstudied, I'll be clear about what that means
- When the medical establishment has gotten things wrong (and they have), I won't pretend otherwise

What the research shows in aggregate may not reflect your individual response. Honor your own experience. And keep looking until you find what helps.
