<Cite id="nams-position-2022" tooltip="The Menopause Society. The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society. Menopause. 2022;29(7):767-794.">Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment</Cite>
for <a href="/symptoms/hot-flashes">hot flashes</a>, <a href="/symptoms/sleep-wont-come">night sweats</a>, and many other symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. And for twenty years, many women who could have benefited from it were denied access—or scared away—because of a study that was badly misinterpreted.

Let me tell you what actually happened, and what we now know.

## The WHI Controversy

In 2002, the Women's Health Initiative study was halted early and its results announced in a press conference that terrified women and doctors alike. Headlines screamed about increased breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes.

Hormone therapy use plummeted by 50% overnight. An entire generation of women suffered through symptoms they didn't need to suffer through.

Here's what got lost in the panic:

**The study population was wrong for the question.** The average age of participants was 63. Many were more than a decade past menopause. This is completely different from treating a 48-year-old in perimenopause.

**The hormones used were specific formulations.** The study used only oral conjugated equine estrogen (Premarin) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera). We now know these aren't optimal—but the results were applied to all hormone therapy.

**The absolute risks were small.** The headlines focused on relative risk increases that sounded alarming but represented very small absolute numbers.

**Benefits were ignored.** The study actually showed decreased fractures, decreased colorectal cancer, and—in the estrogen-only arm—no increased breast cancer risk.

## The Reassessment (2024-2025)

Twenty years of subsequent research, including major analyses from Nature, Yale, the Korean Society of Menopause, and the International Menopause Society, have dramatically shifted the picture:

**The timing hypothesis is validated.** Starting hormone therapy early—within 10 years of menopause, or under age 60—produces different effects than starting late. Early initiation is protective for the heart; late initiation may not be.

**Transdermal estrogen is safer than oral.** Patches, gels, and sprays bypass the liver, don't increase clotting risk, and don't raise blood pressure like oral estrogen can.

**Micronized progesterone is preferred.** Unlike synthetic progestins, micronized progesterone (Prometrium) has a better safety profile, helps with [sleep](/symptoms/sleep-wont-come), and may have a lower impact on breast cancer risk.

**The FDA is changing its stance.** As of 2025, the FDA is initiating removal of the boxed warnings that have scared women and providers for two decades.

## Current Evidence

| Outcome | Finding | Timing Matters? |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Cardiovascular** | Protective if started early; potentially harmful if late | Yes—within 10 years of menopause |
| **Breast cancer** | Small absolute risk increase with combined estrogen + progestin; estrogen-only may not increase risk | Duration matters |
| **Bone health** | Prevents fractures; effect is maintained while taking HT | Any age |
| **Cognition** | May protect if early; may harm if late | Yes—under 60 |
| **[Depression](/symptoms/mood)** | Effective for perimenopausal depression | During transition |
| **[Hot flashes](/symptoms/hot-flashes)** | Most effective treatment available | Any stage |
| **[Vaginal symptoms](/symptoms/dryness)** | Highly effective; local estrogen is safe for most | Any stage |

## Types of Hormone Therapy

### Estrogen Delivery

**Transdermal (patches, gels, sprays):** Generally preferred. <Cite id="nams-position-2022" tooltip="The Menopause Society. The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society. Menopause. 2022;29(7):767-794.">Lower risk of blood clots because it bypasses the liver.</Cite> More stable blood levels than oral. Options include patches (Climara, Vivelle-Dot), gels (EstroGel, Divigel), and sprays (Evamist).

**Oral pills:** Higher risk of blood clots and stroke. Affects liver proteins (including clotting factors). May work better for some women; metabolism varies.

**Vaginal (local):** For [vaginal and urinary symptoms](/symptoms/dryness) specifically. <Cite id="vaginal-estrogen-safety" tooltip="ACOG Committee Opinion No. 659. The Use of Vaginal Estrogen in Women with a History of Estrogen-Dependent Breast Cancer. Obstetrics & Gynecology. 2016;127(3):e93-e96.">Minimal systemic absorption—safe for many women who can't take systemic hormones, including many breast cancer survivors.</Cite> Comes as creams, tablets, rings, or suppositories.

### Progestogen (required if you have a uterus)

If you have a uterus, you need progestogen to protect the uterine lining from estrogen stimulation. Without it, estrogen alone increases risk of endometrial cancer.

**Micronized progesterone (Prometrium):** Body-identical progesterone. Better side effect profile than synthetic progestins. May help [sleep](/symptoms/sleep-wont-come) (take at bedtime). Probably lower breast cancer risk than synthetic progestins.

**Synthetic progestins (MPA, norethindrone):** More side effects—mood changes, bloating—for some women. The type used in the WHI study.

**Hormonal IUD (Mirena):** Provides local progestogen protection to the uterus. Can be combined with estrogen therapy. Good option if you also need contraception (yes, you may still need [contraception during perimenopause](/considerations/contraception)).

### Testosterone

Testosterone isn't FDA-approved for women in the US, but it's used off-label and prescribed routinely in other countries for [low libido](/symptoms/libido), fatigue, and wellbeing. If this interests you, discuss it with your provider—preferably one knowledgeable about menopause.

## Who Can and Can't Use Hormone Therapy

**Generally good candidates:**
- Women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause
- Significant symptoms affecting quality of life
- No contraindications (see below)

**Absolute contraindications:**
- History of breast cancer (though local vaginal estrogen is often still safe—discuss with your oncologist)
- History of blood clots (though transdermal may be considered)
- Active liver disease
- Unexplained vaginal bleeding
- Known or suspected pregnancy

**Situations requiring careful consideration:**
- Family history of breast cancer
- History of stroke or heart disease
- Migraine with aura
- Gallbladder disease
- High triglycerides

If you have a complex medical history, find a provider who specializes in menopause—not one who reflexively says no because they're not comfortable with the nuances.

## Starting Hormone Therapy

Some practical considerations:

**It takes time to work.** Full effect for hot flashes may take 4-8 weeks. Don't give up too quickly.

**Dosing may need adjustment.** Many women start on a standard dose and adjust based on response. Some need more; some need less.

**There may be side effects initially.** Breast tenderness, bloating, spotting—these often settle within a few months.

**You don't have to stay on it forever.** The decision about duration is individual. Some women use it for a few years during the worst of the transition; others stay on it longer. There's no mandatory stop date.

**Stopping should be gradual.** Abruptly stopping can trigger a return of symptoms. Tapering is usually better.

## Finding a Knowledgeable Provider

Many providers are still operating on outdated WHI-era fears. You deserve someone who:

- Understands the timing hypothesis
- Knows the difference between formulations
- Takes your symptoms seriously
- Discusses both risks AND benefits
- Treats you as a partner in decision-making

See [Finding Care](/finding-care) for how to find and advocate with providers.

I hold no allegiance to hormone therapy as the only answer. For some women, [other approaches](/support/beyond-hormones) work better or are more appropriate. For others, hormones are exactly what they need. What I want is for you to have accurate information and the freedom to choose—not to be scared away from an effective treatment by twenty-year-old headlines.
