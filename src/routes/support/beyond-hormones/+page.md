[Hormone therapy](/support/hormone-therapy) isn't right for everyone. Some women can't take it for medical reasons. Some don't want to. Some have tried it and found it didn't work for them. And some simply want to know what else exists.

The good news: there are real alternatives. Some are genuinely new—breakthroughs that didn't exist a few years ago. Others have been around longer but are worth knowing about.

## The Breakthrough: NK3 Receptor Antagonists

This is exciting. For the first time, we have medications that treat [hot flashes](/symptoms/hot-flashes) by directly targeting the [brain mechanism](/whats-happening/brain) that causes them—the hyperactive KNDy neurons in the hypothalamus.

These drugs don't provide estrogen. They don't affect your hormone levels at all. They simply calm the specific neurons that are misfiring.

### Fezolinetant (Veozah)

**FDA approved May 2023**

<Cite id="fezolinetant-skylight" tooltip="Johnson KA, et al. Efficacy and Safety of Fezolinetant in Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms Associated With Menopause: A Phase 3 RCT. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. 2023;108(8):1981-1997.">

- First NK3 receptor antagonist approved for hot flashes
- About 60% reduction in hot flash frequency
- Works directly on the thermoregulatory neurons
- 45mg once daily
- **Important:** Requires liver enzyme monitoring (check before starting and periodically)

</Cite>

For women who can't or won't take hormones but have significant hot flashes, this was the first genuinely new option in decades.

### Elinzanetant

<Cite id="elinzanetant-approval-2024" tooltip="FDA News Release. FDA Approves Novel Drug to Treat Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes Caused by Menopause. December 2024.">**FDA approved December 2024**</Cite>

<Cite id="elinzanetant-oasis" tooltip="Depypere H, et al. Efficacy and Safety of Elinzanetant, a Selective Neurokinin Receptor Antagonist for Vasomotor Symptoms. Menopause. 2024;31(1):9-18.">

- Dual NK1/NK3 receptor antagonist—blocks two pathways
- About 74% reduction in moderate-severe hot flashes by week 12
- May also help [sleep](/symptoms/sleep-wont-come) and possibly [mood](/symptoms/mood) (it affects substance P, which is involved in pain and stress)
- Can cause drowsiness—which is a feature if you have insomnia
- Daily dosing

</Cite>

### What's Coming

**Cendifensine** is in Phase 2 trials. It works on both monoamine and KNDy pathways, and may address mood, food cravings, and hot flashes together. We'll know more as trials progress.

## Antidepressants That Help Hot Flashes

Some antidepressants—SSRIs and SNRIs—reduce hot flash frequency through mechanisms we don't fully understand. They're not as effective as estrogen or the NK3 antagonists, but they help some women.

### Paroxetine (Brisdelle)

<Cite id="nams-nonhormone-2023" tooltip="The Menopause Society. 2023 Nonhormone Therapy Position Statement. Menopause. 2023;30(6):573-590.">

- The only SSRI FDA-approved specifically for hot flashes
- Low dose (7.5mg)—lower than antidepressant doses
- Modest effect—roughly 30-40% reduction in hot flashes
- Side effects can include nausea, headache, sexual dysfunction
- **Important:** Do not use with tamoxifen (drug interaction)

</Cite>

### Venlafaxine (Effexor)

- SNRI used off-label for hot flashes
- Some evidence for effectiveness
- May also help [mood symptoms](/symptoms/mood) at higher doses
- Can be difficult to stop (discontinuation syndrome)

### Other Antidepressants

Escitalopram (Lexapro), citalopram (Celexa), and desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) have some evidence as well. If you're considering an antidepressant for mood anyway, discussing one with hot flash benefits makes sense.

## Other Medications

### Gabapentin

- Anticonvulsant used off-label for hot flashes
- Particularly helpful for nighttime symptoms
- May improve [sleep](/symptoms/sleep-wont-come) as a side benefit
- Side effects: drowsiness, dizziness, weight gain
- Often taken at bedtime

### Oxybutynin

- Originally for overactive bladder
- Repurposed for hot flashes (works on sweating)
- Side effects typical of anticholinergics (dry mouth, constipation)
- Sometimes used when other options haven't worked

### Clonidine

- Blood pressure medication
- Modest effect on hot flashes
- Side effects (low blood pressure, drowsiness) limit usefulness for many women
- Not usually a first choice

### Ospemifene (Osphena)

- For [vaginal symptoms](/symptoms/dryness) specifically, not hot flashes
- Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)—acts like estrogen on vaginal tissue
- Oral tablet
- Option for women who can't use vaginal estrogen
- May cause hot flashes as a side effect (ironic, I know)

## How to Think About These Options

The NK3 antagonists are the most exciting development for women who can't or don't want to take hormones. They work on the actual mechanism causing hot flashes—not just masking symptoms.

Antidepressants make sense when you have both [mood symptoms](/symptoms/mood) and hot flashes. You might address two problems with one medication.

Gabapentin is worth considering if your hot flashes are worst at night and you're also struggling with [sleep](/symptoms/sleep-wont-come).

For [vaginal symptoms](/symptoms/dryness), ospemifene or vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are options—though for most women, local vaginal estrogen (which has minimal systemic absorption) is still the most effective treatment.

## What NAMS/NCCIH Does NOT Recommend

For completeness, here's what major medical organizations advise against:

- **Custom-compounded "bioidentical" hormones** — Quality and consistency issues; not better than FDA-approved bioidentical options
- **DHEA supplements** (for systemic use) — Limited evidence, unclear safety (though vaginal DHEA is approved for vaginal symptoms)
- **Wild yam creams** — Your body cannot convert the compounds in wild yam to progesterone
- **Kava** — Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) risk

None of these options is perfect. All have trade-offs. But having options matters—especially if [hormone therapy](/support/hormone-therapy) isn't right for you.

Discuss these with a [provider who understands menopause](/finding-care). What works depends on your specific symptoms, medical history, and preferences.
